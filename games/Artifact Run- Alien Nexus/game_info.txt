**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- **Timed Maze Run:** Each level is a randomly generated maze with a limited time to escape. Players must move quickly and efficiently to avoid traps and reach the exit.  
- **Alien Traps:** The maze is filled with hazards like energy beams, gravitational pulls, and alien creatures that attack on sight.  
- **Power-Ups:** Scattered throughout the maze are power-ups that grant temporary abilities like speed bursts, shield protection, or teleportation.  
- **Alien Guardians:** At the end of each maze, players face a boss-like alien guardian. Defeating it requires timing and precise movement, with each hit reducing the guardianâ€™s health.

- Complete each maze within the time limit.  
- Collect as many power-ups as possible to improve performance.  
- Defeat the alien guardian to progress to the next level.  
- Unlock new maze themes and alien artifact types as you advance.

**Unique Features:**  
- **Procedural Maze Generation:** No two mazes are the same, ensuring replayability and a fresh challenge every time.  
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** As players progress, mazes become more complex, traps more dangerous, and guardians stronger.  
- **Alien Aesthetic:** The game features vibrant, alien-inspired visuals, including glowing pathways, mysterious symbols, and eerie ambient sounds.  
- **Score and Replay System:** Players can compete for the fastest time and try to beat their own high scores, encouraging repeated play.
