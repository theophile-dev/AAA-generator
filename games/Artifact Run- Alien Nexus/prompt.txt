**Concept Overview:**  
In *Artifact Run: Alien Nexus*, players navigate through a series of procedurally generated mazes, each representing a fragment of an ancient alien artifact.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- **Timed Maze Run:** Each level is a randomly generated maze with a limited time to escape. Players must move quickly and efficiently to avoid traps and reach the exit.  
- **Alien Traps:** The maze is filled with hazards like energy beams, gravitational pulls, and alien creatures that attack on sight.  
- **Power-Ups:** Scattered throughout the maze are power-ups that grant temporary abilities like speed bursts, shield protection, or teleportation.  
- **Alien Guardians:** At the end of each maze, players face a boss-like alien guardian. Defeating it requires timing and precise movement, with each hit reducing the guardian’s health.

- Complete each maze within the time limit.

**Unique Features:**

- **Alien Aesthetic:** The game features vibrant, alien-inspired visuals, including glowing pathways, mysterious symbols, and eerie ambient sounds.  
- **Score and Replay System:** Players can compete for the fastest time and try to beat their own high scores, encouraging repeated play.
