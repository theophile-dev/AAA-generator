Game Idea:
**Game Title:** *Cloud City: Quick Draw Uprising*

**Theme:** A fast-paced, reaction-based game set in a futuristic sky city under rebellion. Players take on the role of a rebel fighter who must react to incoming threats by drawing simple shapes to defend their city.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
In *Cloud City: Quick Draw Uprising*, players control a small rebel drone that hovers above a cityscape. The objective is to defend the city from waves of alien drones that descend from the sky. Each wave consists of 5–10 incoming threats that approach the city in quick succession.

The player must react to each incoming drone by drawing a simple shape—like a circle, square, triangle, or line—on the screen. The shape must be drawn in the correct position and within a time limit. When the shape is completed, it creates a shield or weapon that destroys the incoming drone.

The game uses a "quick draw" mechanic where the player must draw the shape as quickly and accurately as possible. The faster and more precise the draw, the higher the score and the better the defense.

**Objective:**  
Survive as long as possible by defending the city from waves of enemy drones. Each successful defense increases the player's score and unlocks new shapes and power-ups. The game ends when the city is destroyed or the player fails to draw a shape in time.

**Unique Features:**  
- **Simple, minimalist art style:** Uses only 20 single-element PNGs (e.g., city background, drone, rebel drone, shapes, explosion, etc.) for all visual elements.
- **Fast-paced, reaction-based gameplay:** No complex animations or physics—just intuitive drawing mechanics.
- **Progressive difficulty:** Each level increases the speed and number of incoming drones.
- **Power-ups:** Earned by completing shapes quickly, which provide temporary shields or bonus score multipliers.
- **Score-based progression:** The game tracks high scores and allows players to challenge their own times.

---

**Design Considerations:**  
- All graphics are pre-designed as single PNGs (no sprite sheets).
- The game is built using only HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, with minimal logic and no external libraries.
- The code is structured to be easy to implement and extend, with clear functions for drawing, collision detection, and scoring.
