Game Idea:
**Game Title: Reflect & Rule**

**Theme:** *Magic Mirror World*  
**Genre:** *Minimal Chess Puzzle*  
**Core Mechanic:** *Turn-based strategy using mirrored reflections to control movement and capture pieces.*

---

**Concept Description:**

In *Reflect & Rule*, players take control of a magical mirror piece that can move across a grid by reflecting its path. The board is a 5x5 grid where each square contains a single, simple 2D image (like a circle, star, or square) representing a piece. The goal is to use reflections—by flipping the board's orientation—to move your piece across the grid and capture the opponent's pieces.

Each piece can only move in a straight line, but by flipping the board horizontally or vertically, the player can redirect the direction of movement. The mirror piece can also "reflect" other pieces, meaning that if a piece is placed in a mirrored position, it will be treated as if it's in a different orientation, changing how it can be captured or moved.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Board Setup:** A 5x5 grid where each cell contains a single, static image (like a circle, triangle, or square).
- **Player Pieces:** The player controls one piece (a mirror circle) and the opponent controls another (a reflective star).
- **Movement:** The mirror piece can move one square in any direction, but by flipping the board (horizontal or vertical), the movement path can be redirected.
- **Capture:** A piece is captured when it is moved into the same square as an opposing piece, or when it is reflected into a mirrored square.
- **Turns:** Players alternate turns. On your turn, you can choose to flip the board (horizontal or vertical) or move your piece one square in any direction.
- **Win Condition:** Capture the opponent's piece or force them into a position where they can't move.

**Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Uses only 20 simple PNG images (5x5 grid + 5 player pieces + 5 opponent pieces), all single elements with no complex animations or sprites.
- **Mirror Logic:** The reflection mechanic adds a clever twist to the traditional chess puzzle—players must think about how flipping the board affects movement and capture.
- **Strategic Depth:** Simple rules but deep strategy—players must plan ahead, considering how reflections will impact their options.
- **Accessible Difficulty:** Easy to learn, but challenging to master—ideal for casual play and puzzle lovers alike.

---

**Implementation Notes:**

- All assets are single, static PNGs.
- The game logic can be implemented with simple JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
- The board state is managed with an array or object structure to track piece positions and reflections.
- The 500-line code limit can be easily met using minimal logic for movement, flipping, and checking for capture.

---

**Target Audience:**

- Casual gamers and puzzle enthusiasts
- Players who enjoy strategic thinking with minimal complexity
- Educators and parents looking for a simple, fun, and educational game

**Final Thought:**

*Reflect & Rule* is a clever twist on the classic chess puzzle, wrapped in a minimalist, magical world. It’s a game that encourages thinking outside the box—literally—through the power of reflection.
