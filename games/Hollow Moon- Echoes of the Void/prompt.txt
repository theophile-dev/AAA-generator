Game Description
**Game Title:** *Hollow Moon: Echoes of the Void*

**Genre:** Micro Roguelike

**Theme:** A mysterious, dark, and eerie moon where players explore fractured landscapes, uncover ancient secrets, and survive the haunting presence of the void.

---

### **Gameplay Overview:**

*Hollow Moon* is a short, fast-paced micro roguelike where players take on the role of a lone astronaut stranded on a decaying moon. The moon is not solid — it's a hollow, shifting world filled with unstable terrain, strange phenomena, and echoes from a forgotten past.

Each playthrough is a 3–5 minute session, where the player must navigate through randomly generated lunar caverns, collect resources, and reach the core of the moon to unlock its final secret.

---

### **Core Mechanics:**

- **Movement & Exploration:** The player moves in a top-down grid, with simple WASD controls. The world is procedurally generated, with unique layouts and hazards each time.
- **Resource Gathering:** Players collect "Echo Crystals" from glowing nodes scattered across the moon. These crystals are used to power the player’s equipment and progress.
- **Hazards & Survival:** The moon is alive. It shifts, collapses, and emits gravitational pulses that can knock the player off balance or cause environmental damage. Players must manage stamina and avoid deadly traps.
- **Echoes System:** As the player moves, they leave behind visual and audio echoes that can be used to navigate dark areas or reveal hidden paths. However, echoes can also attract dangerous entities.

---

### **Objective:**

The player's goal is to reach the core of the moon, which is hidden deep within the structure. Upon arrival, they must decipher the moon’s final message — a cryptic warning or a glimpse into a forgotten civilization — and decide whether to leave or stay, forever changing the moon’s fate.

---

### **Unique Features:**

- **Echo Navigation:** Players can use echoes to "see" through dark areas, adding a layer of strategy and exploration.
- **Dynamic World Shifts:** The moon’s terrain changes over time, creating a sense of urgency and unpredictability.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** A clean, atmospheric art style with dark hues, glowing elements, and subtle sound design to enhance the eerie mood.
- **Endless Replayability:** Each playthrough offers different layouts, hazards, and secrets, ensuring variety and replay value.
- **Narrative Depth in Micro Form:** A short but impactful story unfolds through environmental cues and the final core reveal, giving depth without lengthy cutscenes.

---

### **Why It Stands Out:**

*Hollow Moon* combines the fast-paced, addictive nature of micro roguelikes with a rich, atmospheric setting and a subtle narrative thread. It’s designed to be played in short bursts, making it perfect for casual players who want a quick, engaging experience without the need for long sessions. The interplay between exploration, survival, and subtle storytelling sets it apart in the micro genre.
