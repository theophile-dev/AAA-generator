Game Description
**Game Title:** *Mutant Blockfall*

**Theme:** Mutant Uprising  
**Genre:** Falling Blocks Puzzle  
**Art Style:** Minimalist, pixel-art inspired, single-element PNGs  

**Concept Overview:**  
*Mutant Blockfall* is a simple yet engaging falling blocks puzzle game where players must prevent a wave of mutant creatures from overwhelming a city. Each level consists of a grid where mutant blocks fall from the top, and the player must arrange them in a way that blocks the mutants' path to the bottom of the screen. The goal is to stop the mutants from reaching the city's core, which is at the bottom of the screen.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- The player controls a single block (a human or hero) that can move left and right.  
- Mutant blocks fall from the top of the screen at a steady pace.  
- The player must position their block to block the path of the mutant blocks, stopping them from reaching the city's core.  
- When a mutant block reaches the bottom, it triggers a "mutant surge" that causes the player’s block to fall and potentially lose a life.  
- The game is won by clearing all the mutants from the screen before they reach the core.  
- The player can only use one block, which must be strategically placed to block multiple mutant paths.  

**Objectives:**  
- Prevent mutants from reaching the city's core.  
- Clear all mutants from the screen in each level.  
- Survive as long as possible in each level, with increasing difficulty.  

**Unique Features:**  
- **Single Block Control:** The player controls only one block, which adds strategy and challenge.  
- **Minimalist Art Style:** The game uses only 20 single-element PNGs for characters, blocks, and environment elements, making it easy to implement with minimal resources.  
- **Falling Blocks Puzzle:** The core gameplay is a puzzle and reflex-based challenge, combining timing and spatial reasoning.  
- **No Sprite Sheets or Complex Animations:** The game relies on simple images and basic movement, making it easy to code in pure JavaScript with minimal lines of code.  
- **Thematic Depth:** The mutant uprising theme gives the game a dark, suspenseful tone, while the puzzle mechanics keep the gameplay fun and accessible.  

**Implementation Notes:**  
- The game can be built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.  
- The 20 PNGs should include:  
  - Player block (hero)  
  - Mutant blocks (various types)  
  - City core (target)  
  - Background elements (city buildings, ground)  
- The game logic is simple: gravity for falling blocks, collision detection, and level progression based on mutant elimination.  
- Each level can be designed with a unique pattern of falling blocks and increasing speed.  

**Target Audience:**  
- Casual gamers who enjoy simple, strategic, and puzzle-based gameplay.  
- Players looking for a quick and engaging game that doesn't require complex controls or graphics.  

*Mutant Blockfall* is a perfect blend of puzzle logic, strategy, and thematic depth, designed to be easy to code and fun to play.
