Game Description
**Game Title: "Steam Float"**

**Concept:**

"Steam Float" is a simple, fun, and engaging 2D platform puzzle game set in a floating steampunk fortress suspended in the sky. The player controls a small, steampunk-style robot that can move, jump, and rotate to navigate through a series of floating platforms, gears, and steam vents. The goal is to reach the top of the fortress and activate the core, unlocking new areas and challenges.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Movement:** The player controls a robot that can move left and right, jump, and rotate in 90-degree increments (up, down, left, right) to change direction.
- **Gravity:** The fortress floats in the air, so gravity pulls the robot downward, but the platforms are arranged in a way that requires strategic movement.
- **Platform Interaction:** Some platforms are static, while others are moving or rotating, requiring precise timing to land safely.
- **Puzzle Elements:** Certain platforms only appear when the player activates a steam valve, which can be done by landing on a specific switch or rotating the robot to trigger a gear mechanism.
- **Steam Vents:** Some vents release steam that blocks movement, but the player can collect steam canisters to clear the path.

**Game Objectives:**

- The main objective is to reach the core at the top of the fortress.
- Each level adds new mechanics, such as moving platforms, rotating gears, and steam vents.
- Players collect "steam cores" to unlock new areas and levels.
- The game includes a simple timer to encourage quick thinking and efficient pathfinding.

**Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Art Style:** The game uses 20 simple .png images, each representing a single element (robot, platform, steam vent, gear, etc.), with no sprite sheets or complex animations.
- **Rotatable Mechanics:** The robot can rotate to interact with rotating gears and environmental puzzles, adding a unique twist to the platforming genre.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Each level introduces a new puzzle mechanic, keeping the gameplay fresh and challenging.
- **No Complex Graphics:** The game relies on clean, colorful designs and simple physics to maintain accessibility and appeal for a wide audience.

**Implementation Notes:**

- All assets are single-element PNGs, making it easy to manage and implement.
- The game uses basic JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas for rendering and interaction.
- The code is concise, with 500 lines of code focusing on core mechanics, collision detection, and level progression.

**Target Audience:**

- Families, casual gamers, and puzzle enthusiasts.
- Designed to be easy to pick up, with a satisfying sense of accomplishment as players overcome each level's unique challenges.

"Steam Float" blends the charm of steampunk aesthetics with the simplicity of platform puzzle gameplay, offering a fun and engaging experience with minimal resources and code.
