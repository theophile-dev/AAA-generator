Game Description
**Game Title: Shadow Drift**

**Theme:** Shadow Planet  
**Genre:** Random Event Game  
**Art Style:** Simple 2D Pixel Art  
**Total Assets:** 20 .png images (single elements only)  
**Code Size:** ~500 lines of JavaScript  
**Target Audience:** All ages, casual players

---

### **Concept Overview:**

In *Shadow Drift*, you're a lone traveler on a mysterious planet known as *Ecliptica*, where the sun never rises, and the sky is a deep, shifting void. The planet is ruled by *Shadow Beasts* — creatures that manifest from the darkness and appear randomly in different forms. Your goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging, avoiding, and defeating these creatures using a simple set of tools and random events.

---

### **Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Movement:** The player controls a small, glowing figure that moves across a procedurally generated, vertical screen. Movement is limited to left, right, and jumping (to avoid falling into the void).
- **Random Events:** Every few seconds, a new *Shadow Beast* appears in a random location on the screen. Each beast has a unique behavior and ability.
- **Beast Types:** The 20 .png images represent different shadow creatures (e.g., tentacle, eye, spike, claw, etc.). Each has its own interaction:
  - Some chase the player
  - Some shoot projectiles
  - Some create hazards (e.g., falling debris)
- **Survival Timer:** The game runs for a set time (e.g., 10 minutes), and the player must avoid all threats for as long as possible.
- **Power-Ups (Optional):** Occasionally, a power-up appears (e.g., shield, speed boost, invisibility) that can be collected to help survive longer.

---

### **Objectives:**

- Survive as long as possible by dodging and managing random shadow events.
- Collect power-ups to increase survival chances.
- Beat your personal best time or score.

---

### **Unique Features:**

- **Simple Controls:** No complex inputs, making it accessible for all ages.
- **Random Events:** Each playthrough is different, keeping the game engaging and replayable.
- **Minimal Art Requirements:** Uses only 20 unique images, each as a single element, allowing for easy creation and implementation.
- **No Spritesheets:** All assets are single .png files, making it easy to manage and load.
- **Mystery and Tension:** The ever-changing nature of the shadow beasts and events keeps the player on edge.

---

### **Design Philosophy:**

*Shadow Drift* is designed to be a short, easy-to-learn, and fun game that emphasizes randomness and survival. It's perfect for a browser-based game with no external libraries, using only HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The minimalistic approach ensures it runs smoothly on any device with a web browser.

---

### **Visual Style:**

- The background is a deep black void with faint glowing stars.
- The player is a small, glowing figure with a light trail.
- Shadow Beasts are dark, featureless shapes with varying movements and effects.
- Power-ups are small glowing icons that appear randomly.

---

### **Conclusion:**

*Shadow Drift* is a simple, engaging, and fun 2D game that leverages randomness and minimal resources to create a unique and replayable experience. It's designed to be easy to implement and enjoy by a wide audience, making it an excellent choice for a quick, browser-based game.
