Game Description
**Game Title: "Vampire Hunt: Chess of Shadows"**

**Concept Summary:**
"Vampire Hunt: Chess of Shadows" is a **Minimal Chess Puzzle** game set in a **vampire hunter** theme. Players take on the role of a lone hunter who must outsmart and eliminate vampires using a simple, strategic board-based puzzle system. The game combines elements of **chess logic** with **vampire lore**, creating a fun, challenging, and accessible experience that can be played in under a minute per puzzle.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- The game uses a **4x4 grid** where each cell represents a position on the board.
- There are **two types of pieces**: the **Hunter** (player-controlled) and **Vampires** (enemies).
- The player starts with **one Hunter piece** and must strategically move it across the board to **capture all vampires**.
- Vampires have **unique behaviors**: some move, some are stationary, and some can only be captured under specific conditions (e.g., during a full moon, or when surrounded by certain items).
- The player must **use the minimal number of moves** to win, akin to a chess puzzle. Each move is a single step, and the Hunter can move in **any direction** (like a king in chess).
- Each puzzle has **a single correct solution**, and the player must figure out the right sequence of moves to eliminate all vampires.

---

**Objectives:**

- **Primary Objective:** Capture all vampires on the board using the fewest moves possible.
- **Secondary Objective:** Complete each level within a time limit or without using certain types of moves (e.g., no diagonal moves, no backtracking).

---

**Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Art Style:** Each piece is a simple, stylized PNG (no sprite sheets), with the Hunter, vampires, and board tiles being distinct and recognizable.
- **Single-Piece Movement:** The game revolves around a single Hunter piece, making it easy to learn and play.
- **Thematic Puzzles:** Each level is themed around a different vampire myth (e.g., Dracula’s castle, Nosferatu’s ship, a cursed village), with unique vampire behaviors and visual cues.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Levels start with simple setups and gradually introduce more complex vampire behaviors, such as movement, teleportation, or special vulnerabilities.
- **No Complex Animations:** The game is built using pure JavaScript and CSS, with only 20 PNGs (each being a single tile or character), and no advanced animation or physics.

---

**Implementation Notes:**

- The game can be played in a **single HTML file** with embedded JavaScript, CSS, and images.
- All images are single elements, with no need for sprite sheets or animations.
- The game is designed to be **playable in under a minute per level**, ensuring it remains engaging and fun for a wide audience.

---

**Target Audience:**

- Casual gamers looking for a quick, strategic challenge.
- Fans of puzzle games and chess logic.
- Players interested in vampire lore and minimalistic design.
- Educators and parents looking for a simple, educational game for kids.

---

**Conclusion:**

"Vampire Hunt: Chess of Shadows" offers a fresh take on the puzzle genre by blending the strategic depth of chess with the dark allure of vampire lore. It’s a game that is easy to learn, hard to master, and perfectly suited for a minimalist, code-light implementation using only 20 images and 500 lines of JavaScript.
