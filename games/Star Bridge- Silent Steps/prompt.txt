Output Requirements

    A complete, runnable single HTML file with embedded <style> and <script>.

    Clear initialization code that sets up the 1024×720 canvas and game loop.

    Basic input handling (keyboard/mouse/touch as appropriate).

    Simple audio is optional; if used, it must be embedded (e.g., base64) and counted within the 500 lines.

    Include minimal UI (start/restart, score/lives, instructions).

Quality Bar

    Stable 60 FPS on a typical desktop.

    Clean structure (modules via IIFEs or simple classes/objects), no frameworks.

Deliverable

Return only the single HTML file content.

Game Description
**Game Title:** *Star Bridge: Silent Steps*

**Theme:** *Star Bridge* – a futuristic, floating bridge that connects stars in a vast, silent cosmos. Players navigate this bridge in complete silence, avoiding detection by unseen sentinels or environmental hazards.

**Genre:** *Basic Stealth Game*

**Core Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Movement:** The player controls a small, silent explorer (a glowing sphere or figure) that moves across a long, narrow, floating bridge. The bridge is made up of individual segments that can be traversed in a top-down perspective.

- **Stealth System:** The player must avoid being seen by sentinels—glowing red orbs that patrol the bridge. If detected, the player is "caught" and must restart the level.

- **Environmental Hazards:** Some parts of the bridge are unstable and may collapse if the player steps on them. Players must time their movements carefully to avoid falling into the void below.

- **No Sound:** The game is entirely silent. All cues are visual, encouraging players to rely on observation and timing rather than sound.

**Objective:**

- Traverse the bridge from one end to the other without being detected or falling into the void.
- Complete all levels to unlock the final star gate and escape the cosmic void.

**Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Visual Style:** The game uses only 20 simple .png images (single elements like the player, sentinels, bridge segments, void, etc.), making it easy to implement and visually distinct.

- **No Spritesheets or Complex Animations:** Each element is a static image, and movement is simulated through position changes.

- **Simple Controls:** The player uses arrow keys or WASD to move, with a pause feature to avoid detection for short moments.

- **Progression System:** Each level increases in complexity—more sentinels, more hazards, and longer bridge segments.

- **Silent Experience:** The game relies on visual cues only, making it accessible to all players, including those who are hearing-impaired.

**Game Structure:**

- 5 levels of increasing difficulty.
- Each level consists of a unique bridge layout with varying obstacles and patrol patterns.
- A final level where the player must navigate a collapsing bridge while avoiding multiple sentinels.

**Why It Works:**

- The game is simple enough for casual players, yet offers strategic depth for those who enjoy stealth and puzzle elements.
- The minimalist approach ensures it can be coded in under 500 lines of JavaScript, using only basic DOM manipulation and event listeners.
- The silent, atmospheric setting creates a unique and immersive experience without requiring complex assets or sound design.
