Game Idea:
**Game Title:** *Clue Stack: The Supernatural Files*

**Concept Overview:**  
*Clue Stack: The Supernatural Files* is a simple, physics-based puzzle game where players take on the role of a supernatural detective solving mysterious cases by stacking objects in a 2D world. The game combines intuitive physics-based mechanics with a charming, low-poly art style, using only 20 single-element PNG images and 500 lines of JavaScript code.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
Players control a supernatural detective who can pick up and throw objects into a 2D environment. The core mechanic is a physics-based stacking puzzle where the player must balance and stack objects to uncover hidden clues and progress through a series of cases. Each case presents a different environment—such as a haunted mansion, a cursed library, or a ghostly forest—each with unique challenges and environmental hazards.

When an object is thrown, it falls under gravity and interacts with the environment, including other objects, walls, and obstacles. The player must carefully plan each throw to create stable stacks that reveal hidden clues or open new pathways. The physics engine is simple but responsive, allowing for fun and intuitive interactions.

**Objectives:**  
- Solve 5 unique supernatural cases by stacking objects in the correct way.
- Uncover hidden clues by creating stable stacks that reveal items or trigger events.
- Navigate through environments by clearing obstacles and using stacked objects to reach new areas.
- Collect all 5 supernatural artifacts to unlock the final mystery.

**Unique Features:**  
- **Minimalist Art Style:** Uses only 20 single-element PNG images, each representing a unique object or environment piece. No sprite sheets or complex animations.
- **Physics-Based Interaction:** Simple yet engaging physics that responds to player input, allowing for intuitive stacking and throwing.
- **Mystery-Driven Narrative:** Each case is a self-contained mystery with a short story, making the gameplay feel purposeful and rewarding.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Cases increase in complexity, introducing new objects, physics interactions, and environmental hazards.
- **No Complex Graphics:** Relies on simple shapes and color to create a clean, fun, and approachable look.

**Target Audience:**  
Designed for a wide audience, including casual gamers and puzzle lovers. The game is easy to pick up, with simple controls and clear objectives, making it suitable for both younger and older players.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Built using only HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.
- All game logic, physics, and rendering are handled with minimal code for simplicity and performance.
- Each object is a single PNG image, loaded and positioned dynamically.
- No external libraries or complex animations are used—everything is hand-coded for efficiency and clarity.

**Conclusion:**  
*Clue Stack: The Supernatural Files* is a fun, engaging, and easy-to-implement 2D puzzle game that marries simple physics mechanics with a supernatural mystery theme. It’s an excellent example of how minimal resources can create a compelling and immersive experience.
