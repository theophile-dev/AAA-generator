Game Idea:
**Game Title: "Maze Match"**

**Theme:** Infinite Maze + Memory Match  
**Genre:** Puzzle / Memory  
**Style:** Simple, clean, retro pixel art aesthetic

---

**Concept Overview:**

"Maze Match" is a simple, engaging 2D memory match game set within an infinite maze. Players navigate a small character through a procedurally generated maze, collecting pairs of matching tiles to clear the level. The goal is to find all matching pairs as quickly as possible while avoiding traps or obstacles that appear as the maze expands.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- The game uses a grid-based infinite maze system where each new section is randomly generated using a simple algorithm that ensures connectivity between rooms.
- The maze is made up of single-element PNGs: walls, floor, doors, and empty spaces.
- Players move in four directions (up, down, left, right) using arrow keys or WASD.
- At the center of each maze segment, there are **6 pairs of matching tiles**, each represented by unique single-element PNGs (e.g., a red square, a blue circle, etc.).
- When a player clicks on a tile, it flips to reveal its image. If two matching tiles are clicked, they are removed from the maze.
- As the player clears pairs, the maze expands in all directions, creating an ever-growing environment.
- A timer is added to encourage quick thinking and matching.

---

**Objective:**

- Clear all matching pairs in the maze.
- Complete as many levels as possible within a set time limit.
- Avoid getting stuck in unreachable areas due to maze structure.

---

**Unique Features:**

- **Infinite Maze Expansion:** The maze grows as the player progresses, ensuring endless replayability.
- **Memory Match Twist:** Combines classic memory matching with maze navigation and spatial reasoning.
- **Minimal Graphics:** Uses only 20 single PNGs (walls, floor, doors, 6 unique tile pairs), making it easy to implement without complex graphics or sprite sheets.
- **Simple Controls:** Keyboard-based movement and tile selection keeps the game accessible to all ages.
- **No Complex Animations:** All interactions are based on static images, making the game lightweight and easy to code.

**Why It Works:**

"Maze Match" is designed to be simple, fun, and engaging for a wide audience. It blends the challenge of memory matching with the exploration of an infinite maze, offering a unique twist on traditional memory games. The minimal art and code requirements make it ideal for beginners or those looking to create a small, polished game with limited resources.
