Output Requirements

    A complete, runnable single HTML file with embedded <style> and <script>.

    Clear initialization code that sets up the 1024×720 canvas and game loop.

    Basic input handling (keyboard/mouse/touch as appropriate).

    Simple audio is optional; if used, it must be embedded (e.g., base64) and counted within the 500 lines.

    Include minimal UI (start/restart, score/lives, instructions).

Quality Bar

    Stable 60 FPS on a typical desktop.

    Clean structure (modules via IIFEs or simple classes/objects), no frameworks.

Deliverable

Return only the single HTML file content.

Game Description
**Game Title: "Hollow Moon Flap"**

**Theme:** *Hollow Moon*  
**Genre:** *Flappy Bird Style*  
**Visual Style:** *Minimalist 2D Pixel Art*  
**Assets Required:** *20 .png images* (single elements, no spritesheets or collections)

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

In *Hollow Moon Flap*, players control a small, floating creature (like a feather or a moon rock) that must navigate through a vast, empty space dominated by a large, hollow moon in the distance. The game is inspired by the simple mechanics of *Flappy Bird*, with a twist of gravity and momentum.

The player taps or clicks to make the creature flap, which gives it upward motion. Without input, the creature is pulled by gravity and falls downward. The goal is to avoid obstacles that float in the air, such as floating rocks, floating platforms, and other celestial objects that drift across the screen.

---

**Objectives:**

The main objective is to reach the Hollow Moon at the top of the screen by navigating through the floating obstacles. Each time the player successfully passes an obstacle, the moon gets closer. The longer the player survives, the higher the score. The game ends when the player collides with any obstacle or falls too far below the screen.

---

**Unique Features:**

1. **Minimalist Aesthetic:** The game uses only 20 simple .png images (like a moon, player, floating rocks, platforms, and background elements) to create a clean, atmospheric look that emphasizes the empty, mysterious space of the Hollow Moon.

2. **No Complex Animations:** All movement and interactions are handled through physics-based movement and simple collision detection. This makes the game easy to implement and run smoothly in a browser with minimal resources.

3. **Gravity and Momentum:** The player must balance between flapping to stay afloat and managing the momentum that pulls them down. This adds a layer of challenge and replayability.

4. **Progressive Obstacles:** Obstacles vary in size and speed, increasing difficulty as the player progresses. The Hollow Moon acts as a visual anchor, growing closer with each successful pass, creating a sense of achievement.

5. **Sound Effects (Optional):** While not required, optional sound effects (like flapping, collision, and background ambiance) can enhance the experience without needing complex audio processing.

---

**Implementation Notes:**

- The game is built using only HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.
- All game elements are created using basic shapes and single images.
- Collision detection is simple, using bounding box checks.
- The game loop is lightweight and efficient, fitting within 500 lines of code.
- The game is designed to be fun for all ages, with intuitive controls and no complex rules.

---

**Final Touch:**

The game ends with a message showing how close the player got to the Hollow Moon, encouraging replay and exploration. The name "Hollow Moon Flap" captures the essence of the game—simple, charming, and a little mysterious.
