Game Description
**Game Title: Star Nomad Clash**

**Concept:**
Star Nomad Clash is a retro-style Space Invaders clone set in a vast, star-filled universe. Players take on the role of a nomadic space tribe, defending their home planet from waves of alien invaders. The game is built with minimal resources — just 20 single-element .png images and 500 lines of JavaScript — making it simple, fun, and accessible for all ages.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- The player controls a small spaceship that can move left and right across the top of the screen.
- Below the player’s ship, multiple rows of alien invaders move horizontally across the screen, slowly descending as they progress.
- The player can shoot bullets upward to destroy the aliens.
- Each alien has a health bar (represented by a single image), and when hit, they shrink and eventually vanish.
- The game has 5 levels, each with increasing difficulty and more alien types.
- After defeating all aliens in a level, the player earns a star and moves to the next level.

**Objectives:**
- Survive as long as possible by defeating waves of aliens.
- Collect stars to unlock new ship designs and power-ups.
- Reach the final level and defeat the alien warlord for a victory screen.

**Unique Features:**
- **Minimalist Graphics:** All elements are single .png images, making the game easy to implement and visually clean.
- **Tribal Themes:** Each level is themed after a different space nomad tribe (e.g., the Zorak, Virex, and Korrak), each with unique alien designs and movement patterns.
- **Power-Ups:** Randomly appearing power-ups like "Shield," "Double Shot," and "Slow Time" add strategic depth and replayability.
- **Sound Effects:** Simple, retro-style sound effects (like laser shots and explosion noises) enhance the gaming experience.
- **No Sprite Sheets:** All assets are single images, making the code clean and efficient.

**Why It Works:**
Star Nomad Clash is designed to be easy to code, fun to play, and visually engaging without relying on complex animations or large asset libraries. Its retro aesthetic and simple mechanics make it ideal for casual players and developers looking for a lightweight, impactful game idea.
