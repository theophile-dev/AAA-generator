Game Idea:
**Game Title:** *Ghost Ship Puzzle*

**Theme:** A ghost ship drifting through icy waters, trapped in a frozen labyrinth. The player must guide the ship through a series of sliding puzzle levels to escape the ice.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
The game is a simple ice sliding puzzle where the player slides the ghost ship across a grid of frozen tiles. Each tile is a single image, and the player can move the ship in four directions (up, down, left, right). When the ship moves, it slides across the ice, and if it collides with a wall or another object, it stops. The goal is to maneuver the ship through a series of levels, avoiding obstacles and reaching the exit.

**Objective:**  
The player must solve each puzzle level by sliding the ghost ship to the exit tile. Each level increases in complexity, introducing new obstacles such as ice anchors, ice blocks, and moving ice platforms. The player must figure out the correct sequence of moves to free the ship and escape the frozen sea.

**Unique Features:**  
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Uses only 20 single-element .png images (ship, ice tiles, exit, obstacles, etc.) to create a clean and engaging visual style.
- **Simple Controls:** Move the ship with arrow keys, with physics-based sliding movement for a sense of realism without complex animations.
- **Increasing Difficulty:** Each level introduces new challenges, such as moving obstacles or limited movement space, keeping the gameplay engaging and challenging.
- **No Sprite Sheets:** All images are individual, making it easy to implement and customize.
- **Replayability:** Players can revisit levels to find faster or more efficient paths.

**Design Philosophy:**  
*Ghost Ship Puzzle* is designed to be accessible and fun for players of all ages. It emphasizes logic, spatial reasoning, and trial-and-error, with a whimsical and atmospheric theme that adds to the charm. The game is built to be easily expandable, with potential for future levels or features without requiring major code changes.

**Technical Requirements:**  
- Pure JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas
- Only 20 single-element .png images
- Limited to 500 lines of code
- No complex animations or external libraries

**Conclusion:**  
*Ghost Ship Puzzle* is a charming, simple, and engaging 2D sliding puzzle game that uses minimal resources to create a fun and atmospheric experience. It balances challenge and accessibility, making it ideal for casual players and puzzle enthusiasts alike.
