Game Description
**Game Title:** *Floating Library Blocks*

**Theme:** A serene, puzzle-based experience set in a floating library where players must arrange falling blocks to restore balance and unlock knowledge.

---

**Gameplay Overview:**

In *Floating Library Blocks*, players control a floating library that hovers over a grid of shelves. Blocks fall from the top of the screen, each labeled with a letter or symbol. The objective is to arrange these falling blocks into complete words or phrases that correspond to books on the shelves. As blocks land, they form a grid, and when a correct word or phrase is formed, the book is unlocked and the shelf is filled.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Falling Blocks:** Simple, single-element PNGs (letters, symbols, or small icons) fall from the top of the screen at a steady pace.
- **Grid System:** A 5x5 grid represents the library shelves. Each cell can hold one block.
- **Matching Words:** Players must match falling blocks into complete words or short phrases (like "book", "story", "library") that appear as hints at the top of the screen.
- **Block Placement:** When a block lands, it can be moved to any empty cell in the grid. Once placed, it can't be moved again.
- **Unlocking Books:** When a word or phrase is completed in the grid, the corresponding book (represented by a simple icon) is unlocked and added to the shelf.

---

**Objectives:**

- Complete as many words or phrases as possible within a time limit.
- Unlock all books in the library by forming the correct combinations.
- Achieve a high score by completing words quickly and efficiently.

---

**Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Design:** Uses only 20 single-element PNGs (letters, book icons, and block placeholders), keeping the game visually simple and easy to implement.
- **Serene Aesthetic:** The floating library theme offers a calm, engaging environment that appeals to a wide audience.
- **No Complex Animations:** All movement and interactions are basic, relying on simple positioning and collision detection.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** As the game progresses, more complex words and phrases are introduced, increasing the challenge.
- **Educational Twist:** The game subtly encourages word recognition and vocabulary building, making it both fun and intellectually stimulating.

---

**Implementation Notes:**

- All game elements are built using pure JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API.
- The 20 PNGs include letters (A-Z), basic symbols, and book icons.
- The game runs in-browser with minimal dependencies, making it ideal for casual play on any device.

*Floating Library Blocks* blends puzzle mechanics with a peaceful, educational theme, offering an accessible and rewarding experience that can be developed quickly with minimal resources.
