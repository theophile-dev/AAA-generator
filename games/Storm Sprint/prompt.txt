Game Description
**Game Title:** *Storm Sprint*

**Theme:** Weather Disaster Survival  
**Genre:** Platform Jumper  
**Core Concept:**  
*Storm Sprint* is a fast-paced, single-screen platformer where the player controls a character who must navigate through a dangerous, ever-changing environment caused by a severe weather disaster — a storm. The goal is to reach the top of the storm while avoiding hazards, managing limited resources, and surviving the elements.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- The player controls a character who can jump, double-jump, and crouch to avoid falling debris or water.
- The environment is dynamic: rain, wind, lightning, and flooding shift the platforms, create hazards, and change the level in real-time.
- The player must collect "Storm Cores" to power up abilities like wind resistance, temporary invincibility, or platform stabilization.
- The storm intensifies over time, creating new obstacles and reducing safe spaces.

**Objectives:**  
- Survive as long as possible while moving upward through the storm.
- Collect as many Storm Cores as possible.
- Reach the top of the storm before it collapses or the player is overwhelmed.

**Unique Features:**  
- **Dynamic Environment:** The level changes with time, creating a sense of urgency and unpredictability.
- **Limited Resources:** Storm Cores are scarce, forcing the player to make strategic decisions on when and how to use them.
- **Simple Controls:** Only jump, crouch, and collect — no complex animations or inputs.
- **Minimal Graphics:** Uses 20 single-element PNGs (player, platforms, water, raindrops, lightning, debris, etc.) to keep the game lightweight and easy to implement.
- **Retro Aesthetic:** Pixel-style visuals with a focus on color and contrast to emphasize the storm’s intensity.

**Design Philosophy:**  
*Storm Sprint* is designed to be accessible and fun for all ages. It emphasizes quick reflexes, adaptability, and resource management in a simple, visually engaging world. The game can be played in a single screen, making it ideal for casual play or quick sessions. The minimalistic art style ensures it runs smoothly even on low-end devices, and the challenge escalates naturally without overwhelming the player.
