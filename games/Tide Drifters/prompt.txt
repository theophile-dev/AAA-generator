Game Description
**Game Title:** *Tide Drifters*

**Theme:** *Ocean Nomads*  
**Genre:** *Push the Box* (2D Puzzle/Platformer)

---

**Concept Overview:**

*Tide Drifters* is a charming, puzzle-platformer game set in a vibrant, ever-shifting ocean world where players take on the role of a nomadic sea creature, navigating through floating islands and underwater realms to deliver essential resources to their community.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- Players control a small, agile sea nomad character that can move, jump, and push floating objects (boxes) through a series of interconnected water-based environments.
- The world is made up of drifting islands, coral reefs, and submerged ruins, all connected by currents and tides.
- The main mechanic is **pushing boxes**, similar to classic *Push the Box* games, but with a unique twist: the boxes are essential resources (like food, tools, or seeds) that must be delivered to specific "nomad camps" or "harvest sites."
- The player can move in all directions, including swimming up and down, and the physics of the water affect movement, making navigation more dynamic and challenging.
- Some boxes are heavy and require the player to use momentum or water currents to move them, while others are light and can be pushed with ease.
- The environment changes over time, with tides and currents altering pathways, requiring strategic thinking and adaptability.

---

**Objectives:**

- The main goal is to **collect and deliver boxes** to designated locations.
- Each level has a set number of boxes to collect, and the player must push them to specific drop zones to complete the level.
- Some levels may have time limits or require completing multiple objectives simultaneously (e.g., collect and deliver, while avoiding predators or natural hazards).
- Unlocking new areas and revealing the world map is a reward for completing levels, encouraging exploration and replayability.

---

**Unique Features:**

- **Tide-Based Level Design:** Each level has a unique tidal pattern that changes the layout, making each playthrough feel fresh and challenging.
- **Underwater Exploration:** Players can explore submerged areas where boxes are hidden, requiring them to navigate through tight spaces or solve simple puzzles to access them.
- **Character Customization:** Players can collect and equip different tools (like a net, hook, or anchor) that help with pushing boxes or navigating the environment.
- **Art Style:** A whimsical, hand-drawn aesthetic with soft watercolor textures and vibrant coral colors that evoke a sense of wonder and exploration.
- **Music and Sound Design:** Gentle, ambient sounds and subtle sea-themed music that enhances the atmosphere and immerses the player in the ocean world.

---

**Tone and Feel:**

*Tide Drifters* is a **calm, meditative, and fun** experience that invites players to drift through a world that feels alive and full of possibility. It’s designed to be accessible to casual players while offering enough depth for puzzle enthusiasts. The sense of exploration and the rhythm of the ocean create a soothing, engaging loop that keeps players returning for more.
