Game Description
**Game Title:** *Dream Sun*

**Genre:** Simple Survival Game

**Concept:**  
*Dream Sun* is a minimalist, atmospheric survival game where players take control of a small, glowing creature called a *Sunling* that lives in a dreamlike world shaped by the sun's warmth. The goal is to survive as long as possible by collecting energy, avoiding environmental hazards, and nurturing the dream world to keep it alive.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- Players move their *Sunling* across a procedurally generated, low-poly world filled with floating islands, bioluminescent plants, and shifting light patterns.  
- The world is powered by the sun, which rises and sets, affecting the environment and the *Sunling*'s abilities.  
- *Sunlings* can collect "sun shards" by interacting with the environment, which increase their health and allow them to create temporary safe zones.  
- The player must manage their energy, as the sun's light fades over time, and the world begins to collapse into darkness.  
- Basic movement is intuitive, with simple touch or click controls for direction and interaction.

**Objectives:**  
- Survive as long as possible by collecting energy and managing the environment.  
- Create safe zones to protect the *Sunling* from environmental dangers like dark storms or collapsing terrain.  
- Nurture the dream world by restoring light to darkened areas, which helps grow new resources and safe spaces.  
- Achieve a high score by surviving longer than previous players, with a leaderboard showing the longest survival time.

**Unique Features:**  
- **Dreamlike Aesthetic:** The game uses a soft, pastel color palette with gentle lighting and fluid animations to create a calming, dreamy atmosphere.  
- **Procedural World Generation:** Every playthrough offers a new, unique world with different hazards and resources, encouraging replayability.  
- **Light and Darkness Balance:** The game emphasizes the balance between light and darkness, with the player actively working to maintain harmony in the dream world.  
- **Minimalist Controls:** The gameplay is designed to be accessible to all ages, with no complex mechanics—just simple interactions that feel rewarding and satisfying.

*Dream Sun* is a peaceful, engaging survival experience that blends exploration, resource management, and environmental care in a beautiful, surreal world.
