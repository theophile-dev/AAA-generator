Output Requirements

    A complete, runnable single HTML file with embedded <style> and <script>.

    Clear initialization code that sets up the 1024×720 canvas and game loop.

    Basic input handling (keyboard/mouse/touch as appropriate).

    Include minimal UI (start/restart, score/lives, instructions).

Quality Bar

    Stable 60 FPS on a typical desktop.

    Clean structure (modules via IIFEs or simple classes/objects), no frameworks.

Deliverable

Return only the single HTML file content.

Game Description
**Game Title: Alchemy Balloon Pop**

**Theme:** Alchemy Revolution  
**Genre:** Simple Balloon Popper  
**Art Style:** Minimalist, 2D, pixel-style with 20 single PNG elements

---

**Concept Description:**

"Alchemy Balloon Pop" is a simple, fun, and engaging 2D game where players use alchemy-based powers to pop balloons in a whimsical, magical world. The game is designed to be easy to pick up and play, with a focus on core mechanics that are intuitive and rewarding.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- The player controls a magical alchemist character who can generate and manipulate basic alchemical elements: **Fire, Water, Earth, and Air**.
- Each element interacts with balloons in unique ways:
  - **Fire** pops balloons on contact.
  - **Water** douses balloons, making them float and then pop when they hit the ground.
  - **Earth** creates solid ground, allowing the player to stand on balloons and pop them by stepping on them.
  - **Air** lifts balloons into the air, letting them bounce and be popped from above.
- Balloons are scattered across the screen and move slowly in random directions.
- The player must strategically use each element to pop as many balloons as possible within a time limit.

**Objective:**

- Pop as many balloons as possible within the time limit (or until all balloons are gone).
- Collect "Alchemy Points" for each balloon popped, and use them to unlock new elements or power-ups.
- The game ends when all balloons are popped or the time runs out, and the player is scored based on the number of balloons popped and time remaining.

**Unique Features:**

- **Single-element sprites:** Each balloon, element, and character is represented by a single PNG image. No sprite sheets or complex animations.
- **Minimalistic design:** The game uses simple shapes and colors to represent elements and balloons, making it accessible and visually appealing.
- **Alchemy theme integration:** The elements are themed around alchemy, giving the game a unique and magical flavor without requiring complex visuals.
- **Easy to implement:** The game can be built with just a few JavaScript functions, basic DOM manipulation, and event listeners, with no need for complex physics or rendering.
- **Progressive difficulty:** As the player progresses, more balloons appear, and the movement patterns become more varied, keeping the gameplay engaging.

**Design Constraints & Goals:**

- Uses **only 20 single PNG images** (balloon, fire, water, earth, air, alchemist, background, etc.)
- Fully **JavaScript-based**, no external libraries or frameworks.
- **Under 500 lines of code**, making it ideal for quick prototyping or learning.
- **No complex animations or graphics** — everything is sprite-based with simple movement and collision detection.

This concept offers a fresh take on the balloon pop genre by introducing a thematic twist with alchemy, all while keeping the game simple, lightweight, and fun for players of all ages.
