Game Description
**Game Title:** *Tundra Runner*

**Theme:** Frozen Wasteland Tribes  
**Genre:** Timed Maze Run

**Concept:**  
In *Tundra Runner*, players take on the role of a member of a nomadic tribe surviving in a harsh, frozen wasteland. The goal is to navigate through a series of ever-changing maze-like environments, avoiding dangers and collecting resources to survive and escape the endless cold.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- Players control a tribal runner who moves through a maze that shifts and reconfigures in real-time.  
- Movement is fast-paced and requires quick reflexes as the maze collapses or alters after a set time.  
- The player can "freeze" the environment temporarily to create a safe path, but this uses up precious energy.  
- Obstacles include ice spikes, falling rocks, and hostile creatures, all of which can freeze the player if touched.  
- The player can collect "heat sources" (like fire crystals) to stay warm and avoid freezing, which slows movement and reduces speed over time.

**Objectives:**  
- Complete each level within the time limit before the environment becomes too unstable.  
- Collect enough resources to unlock new areas and eventually escape the wasteland.  
- Survive as long as possible in the final "Endless Mode" where the maze becomes increasingly complex and dangerous.

**Unique Features:**  
- **Dynamic Maze System:** Each level has a unique maze that changes every few seconds, requiring constant adaptation.  
- **Thermal Management:** Players must balance speed and survival by managing energy and heat, adding a layer of strategy.  
- **Cultural Elements:** The environment and obstacles reflect the tribal culture, with visual and audio cues that hint at the tribes' legends and survival techniques.  
- **Simple Controls:** Intuitive touch or button-based movement with minimal on-screen indicators, making it accessible for all ages.

**Tone & Style:**  
The game has a stark, icy aesthetic with vibrant tribal art elements. The soundtrack blends ambient cold-weather sounds with rhythmic tribal drums to create an engaging and immersive atmosphere.

*Tundra Runner* is a fast-paced, addictive, and visually striking game that combines the tension of a maze runner with the survival challenge of a frozen wasteland.
