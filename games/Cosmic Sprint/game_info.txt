Game Idea:
**Game Title:** *Cosmic Sprint*

**Theme:** Space Beast Hunting  
**Genre:** Side View Racing  
**Core Concept:** A fast-paced, simple side-scrolling racing game where players control a space vehicle racing through an endless cosmic landscape, hunting for alien beasts to collect and eliminate.

---

### **Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Player Movement:** The player controls a futuristic space vehicle using arrow keys (or touch controls for mobile). The vehicle can move forward, jump over obstacles, and shoot beams to stun or destroy space beasts.
- **Racing Mechanic:** The player races through a procedurally generated space tunnel, with the goal of reaching the end of the track as quickly as possible.
- **Beast Hunting:** Randomly appearing alien beasts (represented as simple shapes or symbols) are scattered across the track. Players must shoot them to score points. Each beast has a different point value based on size or speed.
- **Obstacles:** The track includes hazards like asteroid rocks, energy fields, and gravitational pulls that can slow or damage the player's vehicle.
- **Power-Ups:** Occasionally, power-up items like shield boosters or speed bursts appear, which can be collected to enhance the player's abilities temporarily.

---

### **Objectives:**

- **Main Goal:** Reach the end of the track while collecting as many beasts as possible.
- **Scoring:** Points are awarded for each beast collected, and for completing the track within a time limit.
- **Progression:** After completing a track, the player can unlock new vehicle skins, or the difficulty increases slightly by adding more obstacles and faster beasts.

### **Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Art Style:** All elements (player, beasts, obstacles, power-ups) are made from just 20 simple .png images, each a single element (e.g., a triangle for a beast, a circle for a power-up).
- **No Sprite Sheets:** Each game element is a separate image, making it easy to manage and render with pure JavaScript.
- **Simple Physics:** The game uses basic movement and collision detection without complex animations, making it easy to code within 500 lines.
- **Endless Track:** The track is generated randomly, ensuring replayability and variety.
- **Fun and Engaging:** The fast-paced nature, combined with the thrill of hunting beasts and avoiding obstacles, makes it appealing to a wide audience, including casual players.

---

### **Implementation Notes:**

- The game will be built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.
- All images are loaded via simple image tags or `Image` objects.
- Game loop uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth updates.
- Collision detection is handled with bounding box checks between the player, beasts, and obstacles.
- Score and time are displayed in the top-left corner, with a start and pause menu.

**In Summary:** *Cosmic Sprint* is a fast-paced, side-scrolling racing game with a twist of alien beast hunting. It uses minimal graphics, simple mechanics, and a fun concept to create an engaging experience that can be coded efficiently using just 20 images and 500 lines of JavaScript.
