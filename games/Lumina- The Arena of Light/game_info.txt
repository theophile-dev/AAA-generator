Game Idea:
**Game Title: "Lumina: The Arena of Light"**

**Concept Overview:**
"Lumina: The Arena of Light" is a simple, light-switch puzzle game set in a gladiator arena. Players control a gladiator who must navigate through a dark arena by flipping switches that turn on light sources. The goal is to illuminate all the paths to escape the arena or reach a specific goal.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
- The player controls a gladiator who can move in four directions (up, down, left, right).
- The arena is a grid-based environment with walls, light switches, and light sources.
- Light sources are initially off. When a switch is toggled (clicked), it turns on the light, revealing a path forward.
- The gladiator can only move through lit tiles. Dark tiles are impassable.
- The player must strategically toggle switches to reveal the correct path and avoid traps like collapsing floors or enemies.

**Objectives:**
- Reach the exit portal located at the end of the arena.
- Complete each level by illuminating all necessary paths and avoiding obstacles.
- Each level has a unique arrangement of switches and light sources.

**Unique Features:**
- **Minimalist Art Style:** Uses only 20 simple .png images (gladiator, light switch, light source, walls, floor, exit portal, etc.) for a clean and engaging look.
- **Light Switch Puzzles:** Players must think logically to determine which switches to toggle first to reveal the correct path.
- **No Complex Animations:** All movement and interactions are simple and rely on pixel-perfect collision detection.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Each level introduces new mechanics like multiple switches, hidden traps, and multi-step logic puzzles.

**Engagement & Suitability:**
- The game is designed to be easy to pick up and play, making it ideal for casual players and puzzle enthusiasts.
- The clear objective and intuitive controls ensure a fun and satisfying experience for a wide audience.
- The use of light and darkness as a puzzle mechanic adds a unique twist to the gladiator theme, offering a fresh take on traditional arena gameplay.

**Implementation Notes:**
- All elements are built using single .png images, with no sprite sheets or complex animations.
- The game can be coded in pure JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas, requiring only basic event handling and collision detection.
- The small number of images and simple mechanics ensure the game can be implemented within 500 lines of code.
