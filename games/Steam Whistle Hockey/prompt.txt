Game Description
**Game Title:** *Steam Whistle Hockey*

**Theme:** Magical Steampunk  
**Genre:** Simple Hockey Game  
**Visual Style:** Minimalist 2D, using only 20 single-element .png images.

---

**Concept Overview:**

*Steam Whistle Hockey* is a whimsical, turn-based hockey game set in a magical steampunk world. Players control a mechanical hockey player with a steam-powered whistle as their main tool for scoring goals. The game is designed to be accessible, with simple mechanics and a charming aesthetic that appeals to a broad audience.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Players:** Two teams, each with a single steampunk hockey player.
- **Controls:** Players use arrow keys or WASD to move left and right, and spacebar to shoot a puck.
- **Puck Physics:** The puck moves in straight lines, bouncing off walls and players. It can be manipulated using the whistle.
- **Whistle Power:** When the whistle is used, it creates a magical steam burst that pushes the puck in a specific direction, allowing for strategic play and unexpected movement.

---

**Objectives:**

- **Score Goals:** Get the puck into the opponent’s goal (a circular target with a steam valve).
- **Defend:** Prevent the opponent from scoring by blocking or redirecting the puck.
- **Win the Match:** Be the first team to score 5 goals or reach a time limit.

---

**Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Art Style:** Uses only 20 single-element PNG images (player, puck, goal, background, steam effects, etc.) for easy implementation.
- **Whistle Mechanics:** The unique whistle ability allows for creative play and strategic depth without complex animations.
- **Simple Turn-Based Turns:** Players alternate turns, with each turn allowing one shot and one movement, keeping the game fast-paced and easy to learn.
- **No Sprite Sheets:** All elements are single images, reducing file size and making the game easier to code and deploy.

---

**Design Philosophy:**

- **Accessibility:** Simple controls and rules make it easy for players of all ages to pick up and play.
- **Replayability:** The whistle mechanic introduces varied strategies, encouraging multiple playthroughs.
- **Stylish Appeal:** The steampunk theme brings a sense of adventure and whimsy, making the game feel like a fun, imaginative experience.

---

**Implementation Notes:**

- The game can be built with HTML5 Canvas or DOM elements using pure JavaScript.
- All elements are hand-drawn or pixel-art style, with no need for complex animations or physics engines.
- The code will be structured with basic event listeners, movement logic, collision detection, and scoring system.

---

**Final Touch:**

- The game ends with a simple victory screen and a "Play Again" option, looping the game for continuous fun.
- Optional sound effects (e.g., steam hiss, whistle sound, goal celebration) can enhance the experience without requiring complex audio handling.

*Steam Whistle Hockey* is a fun, easy-to-code game that brings the charm of steampunk into a simple, engaging hockey experience.
