Game Idea:
**Game Title: "Ghost Drift"**

**Theme:** Floating graveyard  
**Genre:** Avoid the Walls (a simple arcade-style runner)  
**Visual Style:** Minimalist, pixel-style, with a eerie and calming atmosphere.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

In "Ghost Drift," players take control of a small, translucent ghost who floats through a vast, serene graveyard. The graveyard is filled with floating tombstones, gravestones, and other simple, single-element objects that drift slowly through the screen. The objective is to navigate the ghost through the graveyard while avoiding collisions with the floating structures.

The player controls the ghost using simple left/right movement, and the ghost moves forward automatically. The challenge comes from the shifting positions of the graveyard objects, which float in unpredictable paths, forcing the player to react quickly and dodge.

---

**Objectives:**

- Survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the floating graveyard objects.
- Collect floating "souls" (small glowing orbs) that appear randomly to increase score and unlock special effects.
- Beat your personal best time or score.

---

**Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Uses only 20 single-element PNG images (ghost, tombstones, gravestones, souls, etc.) to create a visually distinct and atmospheric environment.
- **Eerie Calm:** The music and ambient sound design complement the gameplay, creating a peaceful yet suspenseful experience.
- **Simple Controls:** Left/Right movement only, making it accessible to all ages.
- **No Sprite Sheets or Complex Animations:** Everything is static, making it easy to implement with minimal resources.
- **Replayability:** Each playthrough has randomized object positions and soul placements, offering a different challenge every time.

---

**Design Philosophy:**

"Ghost Drift" is designed to be a calming yet engaging experience. The game uses the theme of a floating graveyard to evoke a sense of mystery and tranquility, while the "Avoid the Walls" genre adds a layer of challenge and fun. It's ideal for casual players looking for a light-hearted, easy-to-learn game with a unique and peaceful setting.

This concept is easily scalable for future enhancements, such as adding sound effects, increasing difficulty levels, or introducing power-ups, but all can be built on top of this simple, clean foundation.
