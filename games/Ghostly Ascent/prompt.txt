    Include minimal UI (start/restart, score/lives, instructions).

Quality Bar

    Stable 60 FPS on a typical desktop.

    Clean structure (modules via IIFEs or simple classes/objects), no frameworks.

Deliverable

Return only the single HTML file content.

Game Description
**Game Concept: "Ghostly Ascent"**

**Theme:** Ghostly Wasteland  
**Genre:** Endless Climber  
**Art Style:** Minimalist, single-element PNGs  
**Code Complexity:** 500 lines of JavaScript  
**Art Requirements:** 20 single-element .png images  

---

**Gameplay Overview:**  
"Ghostly Ascent" is a simple, fun, and engaging endless runner-style game where the player controls a ghost character navigating through a desolate, eerie wasteland. The goal is to climb upward as far as possible, avoiding obstacles and collecting floating souls to power up and progress.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**  
- The player controls a ghost that moves upward automatically, with the player able to move left and right to avoid obstacles.  
- The screen scrolls upward, creating the illusion of climbing through a ghostly wasteland.  
- The ghost can collect floating souls (represented by simple circle or star-shaped PNGs) which grant temporary power-ups like speed boosts or invincibility.  
- Obstacles include floating tombstones, broken chains, and ghostly hands that reach out to grab the player.  
- The game ends when the player is caught by a hand or falls off the screen.  

---

**Objectives:**  
- Survive as long as possible by avoiding obstacles.  
- Collect souls to gain power-ups that enhance movement and survival.  
- Beat your own high score and challenge friends.  

---

**Unique Features:**  
- **Minimalist Art Style:** The game uses only 20 single-element PNGs (ghost, tombstone, hand, soul, etc.), making it easy to create and scale.  
- **Simple Controls:** Left/Right movement only, making it accessible for all ages.  
- **Power-Up System:** Players can collect souls to gain temporary boosts that make the climb more exciting.  
- **Ghostly Atmosphere:** The background and obstacles are designed to evoke a haunting, desolate environment, enhancing the eerie feel of the game.  
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Obstacles and speed increase gradually as the player climbs, keeping the gameplay challenging and engaging.  

---

**Implementation Notes:**  
- All assets are single .png files with no sprite sheets or animations.  
- The code is structured to handle movement, collision detection, obstacle generation, and power-up logic in under 500 lines of JavaScript.  
- The game uses basic DOM elements and CSS for rendering, making it easy to run in any modern browser without external libraries.  

This concept is designed to be simple, fun, and visually engaging, with a unique ghostly theme that stands out while keeping the development process lightweight and approachable.
