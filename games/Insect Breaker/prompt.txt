Game Description
**Game Title:** *Insect Breaker*

**Theme:** Giant Insect Invasion  
**Genre:** Brick Breaker  
**Style:** Simple 2D, Pixel Art, Minimalist Graphics

---

**Concept Overview:**

*Insect Breaker* is a fun and engaging brick-breaking game with a twist — instead of bouncing a ball, players control a giant bug that smashes through rows of bricks representing a swarm of invading insects. The goal is to clear all the bricks by using the bug's powerful jaws and legs to smash them, while avoiding incoming attacks from the insects.

---

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **Player Control:** The player controls a giant bug that can move left and right across the top of the screen. The bug can also "bite" by shooting a powerful jaw forward, which can smash a single brick or a cluster of bricks.
- **Brick Layout:** The screen is filled with rows of bricks that represent different types of insects (e.g., bees, beetles, spiders, etc.). Each brick has a unique color and symbol to distinguish them.
- **Enemy Insects:** As the player progresses, insects (represented as falling objects) begin to fall from the top of the screen. The player must avoid them or use the bug's jaw to destroy them before they reach the bottom.
- **Power-ups:** Occasionally, a power-up appears (like a shield or speed boost) that the player can collect to enhance their abilities or protect them from incoming attacks.

---

**Objectives:**

- Clear all the insect bricks from the screen.
- Survive as long as possible by avoiding falling insects.
- Collect power-ups to gain advantages and unlock new abilities or levels.

---

**Unique Features:**

- **Minimalist Design:** The game uses only 20 single-element .png images (bug, bricks, falling insects, power-ups, and background elements), making it easy to implement with minimal resources.
- **Simple Controls:** The player only needs to move left/right and trigger the jaw attack, making it accessible for all ages.
- **Thematic Appeal:** The bug protagonist and insect enemies create a fun and engaging story that's both whimsical and action-packed.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** As the game progresses, more insects fall, and the brick layout becomes more complex, keeping the challenge fresh.

---

**Visual and Audio Style:**

- **Graphics:** Simple pixel-style images with bold colors and clear shapes. Each element (bug, brick, insect) is a single image, no sprite sheets or complex animations.
- **Sound:** Optional background sounds (e.g., buzzing, smashing, and power-up effects) to enhance immersion without requiring advanced audio coding.

---

**Technical Requirements:**

- Written in pure JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries).
- Uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering.
- All assets are preloaded and drawn using basic image manipulation and positioning.
- Only 500 lines of code total, keeping the implementation lightweight and easy to modify.

---

**Target Audience:**

- Families, casual gamers, and anyone looking for a simple, fun, and addictive game with a unique twist on the classic brick-breaker genre.
